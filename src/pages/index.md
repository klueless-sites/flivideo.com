## A little about me

I love software development and I love video based learning, content and marketing.

I got my first computer in 1982 (Texas Instruments TI99/4A) and I wrote my first program by copying code out of a subscription magazine when I was 10.

I have been a professional software developer for 30+ years and dabbled in SEO, content and video marketing for the last 15 years.
