## Overview

The following FactoryBot and Faker examples are for various data generation scenarios. Each scenario is listed with with a Pros and Cons.



### Unit test data

Data required for various test cases. This data just needs to meet the minimum requirement for a unit test.

## XXXX

## YYYY

### Seed data

Seed data when an environment is create, example: application setup there needs to an admin user and a bunch of pre-defined settings.

### Sample data

Sample data is often a larger dataset with realistic examples for use in development, UAT or demo environments.

#### Pros/Cons legend

- <Useful /> - Good pattern for the usecase
- <Useful answer="no" /> - Not the best pattern for this usecase
- <Useful answer="maybe" /> - Ambivalent, this neither good nor bad, but there is generally a better usecase.

### Static attribute values

Static data on factory attributes can be useful for any type of data generation

```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :user do
    first_name { "John" }
    last_name  { "Doe" }
    admin { false }
  end
end
```
