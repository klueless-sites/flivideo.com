## When not to use crop mode (technique 1)

Note: You don't use cropping as a way to resize your video, instead try using scaling.

**Scenario**

You have recorded the entire 4K screen with your target window in the middle of the screen

You decide to crop the video to only show the window.

The cropped window now looks very pixelated and blurry because the video is still 4K.

## Solution

Assuming that your recorded video is 4K

1. Set the video dimensions to FHD (1920x1080) 1080p in project settings
2. Now you can reposition the focus window to the center of the video canvas
3. Click on the canvas and in the properties panel, set the scaling to the desired size.

Once you have scaled the input video so that the desired area takes up most of the canvas, you can then optionally crop the video with minimal loss of quality.
