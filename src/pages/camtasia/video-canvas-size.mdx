Note: remember to set your video dimension before you crop.

## Scenario

You have recorded the entire 4K screen with a window in the middle.

You decide to crop the video to only show the window.

The cropped window now looks very pixelated and blurry because the video is still 4K.

## Solution

1. Set the video size to 1080p
2. Now you can crop the video to show the window area you are interested in.
